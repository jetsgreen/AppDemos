                    I was in the banking industry for over 12 years. I started as a Lending officer and finished as a
                    Junior Financial Adviser. I obtained several investment licenses, including series 7, and 66. I left
                    the banking industry four years ago to pursuit my own business. I established Felix Luxury Limo, a
                    transportation business mainly operating in New York City. I am currently finishing up a coding boot
                    camp which will allow to become a Full Stack Developer. I feel like I finally discover a true
                    passion in computer programming. It gives me the sense of accomplishment I have been searching for
                    my whole professional career.
